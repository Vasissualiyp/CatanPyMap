# CatanPyMap
This is a python code that creates a map for Catan, playable on a TV. This repo is a python rewrite of https://github.com/dado3212/catan

CatanPyMap is a Python-based project that generates maps for the board game Settlers of Catan for 3-4 players. It's designed to project the generated map on a TV for a more immersive gaming experience.

### Structure of the Project

The project is structured into several Python files, each serving a different purpose:

1. `index.py`: Contains the main classes and functions to set up the game and draw the game board.
2. `main.py`: The entry point of the application. It uses the `index.py` and `helper.py` to set up the game, draw it, and then encode the game state.
3. `helper.py`: Contains several helper functions that are used across the application.
4. `number_asset_generator.py`: Generates image assets for the numbers used in the game.

### How to Run

To run the application, execute the `main.py` script:

```
python3 main.py
```

### Configuration

The `Params` class in `index.py` contains several parameters that you can adjust to fit your setup. Here is a brief description of each parameter:

- `board_size`: The size of the game board. 
- `tile_size`: The size of the tiles on the game board. 
- `tile_spacing`: The spacing between tiles on the game board. 
- `asset_location`: The location of various game assets. 
- `start_x` and `start_y`: The starting points for the rows of tiles on the board.

Adjust these parameters as needed to make the game fit your TV screen.

### Game Modes

There are three game modes available, each offering a different way to set up the game:

- `new_random_game()`: Sets up a game with a completely random board.
- `new_pseudo_random_game()`: Sets up a game with a pseudo-random board.
- `new_spiral_game()`: Sets up a game with a spiral board.

Choose the one that fits your preference.

### Game State Encoding

The game state is encoded into a base64 string using the `encode` function from `helper.py`. This encoding is used to persist the game state and can be decoded using the `decode` function from the same file.

### Number Assets

The numbers used in the game are represented by image assets generated by the `number_asset_generator.py` script. If you want to change the appearance of these numbers, you can adjust the `create_image` function in this script.
